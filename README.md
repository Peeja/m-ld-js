## v0.3
This version includes some improvements to how **m-ld** stores and transmits
changes, which drops the bandwidth overhead considerably for transactions that
impact more data. The storage is backwards-compatible, but the messaging is not,
so you need to ensure that if any clone uses the v0.3 engine, all the other
clones do too.
